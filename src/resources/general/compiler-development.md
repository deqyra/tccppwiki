# Compiler Development

## Resources for learning about compilers:

- _Engineering a Compiler_ (https://www.elsevier.com/books/engineering-a-compiler/cooper/978-0-12-815412-0) (Mostly for
  compiler back-ends and optimization)
- _Crafting Interpreters_ (yes, even for compiler devs, https://craftinginterpreters.com/) <--- Very beginner friendly
- LLVM's Kaleidoscope (https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/)
- _Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_ (The dragon book)
  (https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811) (Fairly heavily focused on parsers.)

## Resources for learning about programming language design

- _Types and Programming Languages_ (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl)
- _Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages_
  (https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2718/Advanced-Topics-in-Types-and-Programming-Languages)
- _Practical Foundations for Programming Languages_ (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/)

## Resources covering both topics

- _Essentials of Programming Languages_ (https://eopl3.com/)

## Resources for learning about optimizations:

- _"What Has My Compiler Done for Me Lately"_ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4)
- _Optimizations in C++ Compilers: A practical journey_ (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3371595.3372264)

## Resources for learning about computer architecture:

- _Essentials of Computer Architecture_
  https://github.com/ccceye/computer-book/blob/master/Essentials%20of%20Computer%20Architecture%2C%202nd%20Edition.pdf
