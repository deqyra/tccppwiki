# Setting up Visual Studio Code for Windows

Visual Studio Code (abbreviated VS Code) is an open-source text editor developed by Microsoft. It is highly configurable
and allows developers to tweak every bit of their workflow to their liking. Configuring it however can quickly get
involved, which for beginners can be a deal breaker. Windows users in particular may choose to go with
**[Visual Studio Community](/resources/dev-envs/visual-studio-community)** for a smoother experience.

## What's the difference between VS Code and Visual Studio Community?

<VisualStudio /> **Visual Studio Community** is an IDE for Windows. When you install it, you get all big three
components of any respectable C++ development environment at once: an editor, a compiler, and a debugger. All three of
them are set up to work together, which means you can get to writing, compiling and debugging code right away.

<VSCode /> **VS Code** is a text editor on steroids. It's available on every major OS, packs a lot of developer-oriented
features and provides facilities to interact with other tooling. On its own, VS Code is about as good as any other
decent text editor, leaving up to you all the extra steps that there are to compiling and debugging C++ code. In order
to get closer to an IDE experience like that of Visual Studio Community, you need to install a compiler and a debugger
separately, and then configure VS Code to work with them. It's more work, but you end up with a more flexible and
customizable setup, and you get acquainted with your toolchain along the way.

This entire page will guide you through installing and configuring all the tools you need to use VS Code as a C++-ready
IDE. Be aware though that it is going to be a fairly long read. The amount of new information was kept at a minimum, but
it can still be lots to take in. Take breaks if you feel like you need them. This page isn't going anywhere, so go at
your own pace. ðŸ™‚

::: info About this page

The instructions which follow are largely sampled from **[HolyBlackCat's repository of C++ tutorials]**. Feel free to
visit it for a more in-depth tour of the options you have and the rationale behind the choice of tools we will be
installing.

## Installing a C++ toolchain

A toolchain is a set of tools which when used together can turn C++ code into an executable file. This section explains
how to install Clang and its associated tools through MSYS2, a distribution of MinGW.

::: tip Quick glossary

**MinGW**, an acronym for _"Minimalist GNU for Windows"_, is a set of common Linux tools which were ported to Windows to
provide a Linux-like environment on Windows. MinGW does not have an official installation binary, instead we get to
choose from different distributions of MinGW.

**MSYS2** is one such packaging of MinGW. It is complete, convenient, up-to-date and still maintained today.

**Clang** is a compiler. Its job is to compile C++ code and to produce an executable file. Clang comes with a bunch of
tools that we'll be using throughout this page, and installing Clang through MSYS2 allows us to have the entire suite of
Clang-related tools installed with it.

:::

1. **Download the installer** from the [MSYS2 website] and run it.

Leave the default install location unchanged. If for some reason you _must_ change it, make sure it contains only
unaccentuated Latin characters and no spaces. The rest of this page assumes that you installed MSYS2 in the default
location, `C:\msys64`.  
If you run into any strange issues during installation (or at any later point), try disabling your antivirus software or
adding the MSYS2 install location as an exception in its settings.  
Uncheck the `Run MSYS2 now` option at the end of installation, or close the window that the installer opens.

2. **Start MSYS2**

The Windows Start menu will have several different shortcuts. Select the one which reads `MSYS2 CLANG64`.  
![MSYS2 environments in the Windows Start menu](/assets/msys2-env-shortcuts.png)

The window that opens is called a "terminal" or a "console". You can type commands in there to interact with the MSYS2
environment.  
**Make sure** the prompt reads `CLANG64` in purple text. If it says something else, you used the wrong shortcut. Close
that terminal and start the correct one instead.

3. **Update MSYS2**

The following commands should all be run in the MSYS2 CLANG64 terminal. First, run **`pacman -Syu`**.

::: warning Pasting commands in the MSYS2 terminal

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> doesn't work in the MSYS2 terminal. Instead, use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</Kbd>, or
right-click anywhere and select "Paste".

:::

When you run the command above, you will eventually be asked to confirm the operation:

```:no-line-numbers
:: Proceed with installation? [Y/n]
```

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to continue.

It is possible that you get this message sometimes:

```
:: To complete this update all MSYS2 processes including this terminal will be closed. Confirm to proceed [Y/n]
```

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and the terminal will close. **If this happens, restart the MSYS2 terminal and run `pacman -Syu`
again to finish the update.**

::: tip What is `pacman`?

`pacman` is the package manager for the MSYS2 environment. Packages can be anything ranging from programs and libraries
to text files, and `pacman` is a convenient utility which knows where to fetch packages from, how and where to install
them, how to update them, how they depend on one another so you don't have to figure that out yourself.

This command you just ran updated `pacman`'s package database (the list of places where it can fetch packages from) and
upgraded to newer versions the installed packages which were found to be outdated. It's a good idea to run this command
every once in a while to keep your tools up-to-date.

:::

4. **Install the Clang toolchain**

Run `pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang` to install the entire Clang toolchain. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> when asked to
confirm. You'll notice that a fair amount of stuff is getting installed. This is `pacman` working its magic to install
not just Clang and its associated tools but also every other package required for them to properly function.

After a short while, the installation will be over. Now, type `clang++ --version`. You should see something like this:

```:no-line-numbers
clang version 20.1.0
Target: x86_64-w64-windows-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: C:/msys64/clang64/bin
```

This means you successfully installed Clang.

## Installing VS Code

Go the [VS Code website], download the installer, and run it to install VS Code. This doesn't require any special
instructions, just make your way through the installer.

Next, we need to tell it how to work with all the tools we installed in the previous sections. We'll begin with the
terminal. Start your freshly installed VS Code.

## First encounter with the VS Code terminal

VS Code has a built-in terminal, which you can open by selecting `View`â†’`Terminal` in the top bar. In the panel which
appears, you should see a prompt that resembles the following:

```:no-line-numbers
PS C:\Users\user>
```

If you go ahead and try to run `clang++` in it, like you did above, you are going to get an error:

```:no-line-numbers
PS C:\Users\user> clang++ --version
clang++ : The term 'clang++' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is
correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ clang++ --version
+ ~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (clang++:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
```

That is because this terminal instance uses a different shell, in this case PowerShell, as is displayed by VS Code in
the top-right corner of the terminal pane.

::: tip What is a shell?

A **shell** is a program that accepts commands from you (such as `clang++ --version`, which you ran above) and executes
them (often by running other programs, in this case by running the Clang compiler).

A **terminal** is a dumb program that displays text. A shell is what actually understands the commands you type.

A shell and a terminal are usually used together: the terminal **provides the window and draws text in it**, while the
shell **interprets the user commands**. The MSYS2 terminal from before uses a shell named Bash.

:::

You can usually recognize a shell by its _prompt_ (the text it prints when asking you for a command). You have to know
which shell you're using, because as you noticed the difference can matter: you can run `clang++` in MSYS2 Bash but not
in PowerShell **_by default_**.

When you ran `clang++ --version` in the MSYS2 terminal, it ended up running a program named `clang++.exe` located at
`C:\msys64\clang64\bin`:  
![An Explorer window showing where Clang++ is located](/assets/clang-exe-location.png)

The reason why the MSYS2 shell knew to look there for `clang++.exe` is because of a setting called `PATH`.

## The `PATH` environment variable

`PATH` is a list of directories that will be searched by a shell when it needs to run a program. To see the contents of
`PATH`, run `echo $env:PATH` in VS Code's PowerShell and `echo $PATH` in the MSYS2 terminal. The commands are different
because the shells that you run them in are different, and expect things to be in a slightly different format. You
should see this:  
![PATH printed in both MSYS2 Bash and PowerShell](/assets/default-shell-paths.png)

Yours might not exactly match those on the screenshot, but the point is that we get two different lists of directories.

In MSYS2, the first one is `/clang64/bin`. The `/` at the beginning refers to the MSYS2 installation directory, so this
entire path actually translates to `C:\msys64\clang64\bin`. This directory is where `clang++.exe` is located, and this
is why the MSYS2 shell knows what to do when asked to run a command like `clang++ --version`. In PowerShell however,
this directory isn't listed at all, which is the reason PowerShell did not understand that command.

Luckily, the fix is simple: we only need to change the value of `PATH` in Windows.

To do so, type `env` in the Windows search bar, and choose _Edit the system environment variables_. Then in the window
which opens, click the button which reads `Environment Variables...`.

You will see two lists of variables, with `Path` in both of them. The top list (_User variables_) applies only to the
Windows user whose session is currently open, while the bottom list (_System variables_) applies to every user on this
computer. In this case, you want to modify the _System variables_, and add the `C:\msys64\clang64\bin` directory **at
the very beginning of the list** (click the button labeled `New`, edit the path, and then press the `Move up` button a
bunch of times). Doing so gives it the most priority, which will spare you a bunch of trouble in the future.
![Modifying the value of PATH in Windows](/assets/modifying-path.png)

When you're done modifying `PATH`, **restart VS Code**. This is needed for the changes to be propagated to the built-in
terminal. After restarting, if you try to run `clang++ --version` again in the VS Code terminal, it should give you the
same output as it did in the MSYS2 terminal. If you run `echo $env:PATH` again, it should now list
`C:\msys64\clang64\bin` as the first entry in the list:
![New value of PATH in PowerShell](/assets/powershell-updated-path.png)

At this point, you are ready to write C++ code and compile it with the terminal, all from VS Code.

## Your first C++ program

Finally, it's time. First, you'll have to create a workspace. Workspaces are VS Code's very loose equivalent of what
other IDEs might call a project. Any directory on your disk can be opened as a workspace in VS Code, and when you do so,
VS Code simply lists the files that it contains and lets you work with them. The structure of the actual project (or
projects, plural!) which live within the workspace is completely unconstrained by VS Code.

Let's create a workspace then. On the welcome page in VS Code, select the "Open folder" option. If you closed the
welcome page, you can bring it back by selecting `Help`â†’`Welcome` in the top bar. Alternatively, you can tell VS Code to
open a folder with the key chord <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.

::: tip Pressing key chords

Sometimes, usual key shortcuts like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> are not enough, and
specific actions call for slightly more complex shortcuts. That's what key chords are.

When you see something like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>, you need to press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> first, and then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>. You can keep the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key
pressed for the entire duration of the chord and simply press <kbd>K</kbd> and then <kbd>O</kbd> in quick succession.

VS Code is full of those. Some of them are more useful than others, but all of them can be customized to your liking.

:::

In the Explorer window which opens, browse to a location you can easily find back later and create a new directory,
which will be the workspace for your first C++ program. You can give this directory any name you like, but avoid spaces
and accented or non-Latin characters, as some tools tend to choke on those. Once created, select your new workspace
directory and click the "Select folder" button at the bottom-right of the Explorer window.

At this point, VS Code might be asking you whether you trust the authors of the workspace you're trying to open. This is
only a concern when you're working on projects that you fetched online from untrustworthy sources. Click the button
which reads "Yes, I trust the authors".

Your window should now look like the following:  
![Empty workspace in VS Code](/assets/vscode-empty-workspace.png)

Not much has changed, except for the left sidebar. It's labeled _Explorer_, and its job is to show the files and
directories that your workspace contains. At the moment there are none, that's why it's completely blank except for the
name of the workspace directory (`CPP_DEMO` in the screenshot above). Let's fix that right now by adding some files.

If you hover on the sidebar, which we will now refer to as the _file explorer_, you'll see a bunch of icons showing up
in the top-right corner:  
![File explorer icons in VS Code](/assets/vscode-file-explorer-icons.png)

Click on the leftmost icon to create a new file in the workspace. VS Code will add an entry in the file explorer and
will wait for you to give it a name. It can be anything, as long as it does not contain spaces, nor accented or
non-Latin characters, and it should also have the `.cpp` extension. For example, `prog.cpp` is a correct name.

::: tip File extensions

Conventionally, the extension of a file is the bit which comes after the last dot in the file name. It can be
arbitrarily long or small, and it's even possible to have a file without an extension. In any case, the extension of a
file is supposed to give an idea of what that file contains.

By giving our new file the extension `.cpp`, we tell VS Code that this file is a _C++ source file_, meant to contain C++
code. As a consequence, VS Code will apply C++ syntax highlighting to any code we write in this file.

:::

Once you're happy with your new file's name, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. VS Code creates the file and immediately opens it
in the editor for you.

::: warning

It is possible at this point that VS Code might be trying to be smarter than it really is, by suggesting that you
install the "C/C++ extension pack". **Ignore that suggestion and dismiss the pop-up. Do not install the extension
pack.** We will get to that in a short time.

:::

Paste the following bit of C++ code in your newly created file:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello!\n";
}
```

This code, when ran, will print "Hello!" in the terminal. The specifics of it are not so important for now, the goal is
simply to test that your setup works. Save your file by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> while the editor is
focused.

::: warning Saving files

When you type in VS Code's editor, you can see your modifications live. Those modifications make it to the disk **only
when you save the file.** If you forget to save your file and then compile it, you'll actually be compiling a previous
version of your file, and the results will not be consistent with your expectations. This is a common source of
confusion among beginner programmers.

VS Code shows the status of the file next to its name in the editor tab at the top.  
![Display differences between saved and unsaved files in VS Code](/assets/vscode-unsaved-file.png)

A white dot in place of the cross button indicates that the file has _unsaved modifications_. Such modifications are not
present on disk and cannot be compiled until you save the file, which you can do by pressing
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> while having the file open and focused in the editor.

:::

The next step is to actually compile your file. Open the terminal again by selecting `View`â†’`Terminal` in the top bar.
You'll see that something is slightly different from the last time:  
![VS Code terminal open in a workspace](/assets/vscode-terminal-open-in-workspace.png)

VS Code has opened the terminal in our workspace directory, as you can tell from the path printed as part of the prompt.
This is a good thing, it will save us some typing. If you named your C++ file `prog.cpp`, the command to compile it is
the following:

```:no-line-numbers
clang++ prog.cpp -o my_first_program.exe
```

Let's break down that command a little bit:

- **`clang++`**: that is the name of the compiler executable. PowerShell will find `clang++.exe` and run it.
- **`prog.cpp`**: this is the C++ file that we want to compile. You should change this to match the name that you gave
  to your C++ file in the previous steps.
- **`-o`**: in a command, something which begins with a dash `-` is an option. In short, options allow you to tell the
  invoked program how to behave. The available options depend on the program. For Clang, the `-o` option is there to
  tell that whatever follows next will be the name of the output file that `clang++` will produce. In our case, the name
  is...
- **`my_first_program.exe`**: following the `-o` option, this is the name of the executable file that we end up with. It
  can be anything, the only requirement is that it has the `.exe` extension so that Windows recognizes it as an
  executable file.

Tweak the command so that it matches your situation, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run it. A successful compilation will
print nothing. If there's an error in the compiled code, it will be printed in the terminal. If you have errors, check
that the content of your C++ file matches the code from above and **make sure that you save the file** before trying to
run the command again.

After the compilation is successful, you should see a file named `my_first_program.exe` appear in VS Code's file
exporer. This is indeed your first C++ program. You did it! You can try to run it from the terminal by typing
`./my_first_program.exe`, and see for yourself that it indeed prints `Hello!` in the terminal before yielding back to
the prompt.

If running your program does nothing or yields an error, make sure you correctly followed the instructions regarding
[the `PATH` environment variable][path_instructions]. In particular, `C:/msys64/clang64/bin` must be in the system-wide
`PATH`, not the user-specific `PATH`, and it has to be the first element in the list of directories.

Before we go on, here are details about a couple noteworthy oddities that you might have noticed and which deserve some
clearing up.

### The terminal's current directory, relative paths and absolute paths

Terminals have a concept of a "current directory". The shell usually reminds you what the current directory is, by
printing its path as part of the prompt. Usually, most paths that you provide in a command are considered to be
_relative_ to the current directory. This is why we were able to supply `prog.cpp` to Clang only by its name, and not by
its full path: when VS Code opened our terminal, it set its current directory to our workspace directory, and from
there, `prog.cpp` is enough to locate the C++ source file that we created.

There is only one case in which a path is not considered a relative path, and that's when the path is an _absolute_
path. Absolute paths have a specific form and are never relative to a given directory. They unambiguously identify a
location in the file system. On Windows, absolute paths start with a drive letter and a colon. Continuing the example
from above, `C:/code/cpp_demo/prog.cpp` would be the absolute path to our C++ source file. We could have supplied that
path in the compile command, instead of just `prog.cpp`, Clang would have happily compiled it all the same. It's just
more typing.

### The `./` prefix for invoking programs in PowerShell

The `./` prefix is made of two characters: `.`, which designates the terminal's current directory, and `/`, the
universal path separator.

::: tip

On Windows, `\` is the historical path separator, but `/` works equally well and is more accessible, so we use that
instead.

:::

In essence, `./my_first_program.exe` simply means: "I want to run the file `my_first_program.exe` located in the current
directory". Following the previous remarks about relative paths and whatnot, you might wonder: if our terminal's current
directory is our VS Code workspace, and our executable file was written to that same directory, then why did we need
such a prefix at all? Wouldn't `my_first_program.exe` have sufficed as a command? This is a quirk of PowerShell: by
default, invoked programs are not searched in the current directory as a safety measure. The `./` prefix is required to
prevent you from doing something that you otherwise might not have intended.

### Spaces in paths

Up until now, you have been advised not to include spaces or accented or non-Latin characters in the paths you're
dealing with. While the latter kind of such characters can indeed present issues, spaces _can_ be fine most of the time.
If a path has spaces in it and you want to supply it as a command line argument, you have to put double quotes around it
so that the entire path is considered as one whole argument. For example:

```:no-line-numbers
clang++ prog.cpp -o "my first program.exe"
```

However, spaces in paths have a history of causing subtle problems which can be stupidly hard to diagnose. For this
reason, paths with spaces are unconventional and generally avoided. If you need a non-alphabetic separator in a path,
underscores `_` are a perfect candidate for a replacement.

With that out of the way, we can move on.

## Code completion

Code completion is a feature most IDEs have which provides suggestions as you type your code.  
![VS Code autocomplete suggestions](/assets/vscode-autocomplete.png)

It's usually the same component which underlines your code with red squiggles when it contains errors, without having to
compile.  
![Underlined errors in VS Code](/assets/vscode-red-squiggles.png)

You don't _have_ to use code completion, and writing a few simple programs without code completion is a good learning
experience. But for more complex projects it's invaluable.

VS Code does not support code completion on its own. For most languages, you have to install an extension. We will be
installing [Clangd] (not to be confused with Clang), a C++ _language server_. Language servers are the things which
actually power features such as code completion and the likes.

Clangd is a separate program that we need to install in MSYS2, outside VS Code. Open the MSYS2 CLANG64 terminal again
(make sure to open the CLANG64 variant) and run the command `pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang-tools-extra`. This
will install Clangd right next to the other Clang tools which we installed previously.

There is one final issue before code completion is properly set up: VS Code doesn't know how to speak with Clangd. To
bridge the gap between the VS Code editor and the Clangd executable that we just installed, we need to add the Clangd
extension to VS Code. It will act as a middle man between both, enabling code completion.

Go to the extension marketplace in VS Code, search for `Clangd`, and install what should be the first result:  
![Clangd in the VS Code marketplace](/assets/vscode-clangd.png)

That's all you have to do. Now if you go back to your C++ file and type nonsense in it, red squiggles should not take
long to appear.

**If you get this pop-up after installing the Clangd extension:**
![VS Code Clangd suggesting to install a language server](/assets/vscode-clangd-popup.png)

**Do not click on `Install`**. We just installed Clangd _via_ MSYS2, and the extension is supposed to be using it. The
Clangd extension not finding the Clangd program that we just installed suggests one of two things:

- As hinted by the text in the pop-up, your `PATH` is not properly configured. Refer to the [instructions for setting up
  the `PATH` environment variable][path_instructions]. Don't forget to restart VS Code afterwards.
- You installed Clangd in a different MSYS2 environment (instead of the CLANG64 environment that we're using since the
  beginning), which would also explain why it can't be found on your `PATH`. Install Clangd from MSYS2 again, this time
  in the correct environment. Once you did that, restart VS Code to reload the Clangd extension.

## Automating compilation

Compiling manually in the terminal like we did before gets old very quickly. You can automate this in VS Code by binding
hotkeys which will run the compile command for you. To that effect, we will be using something called _tasks_.

A task in VS Code is a prepared shell command that you can run by pressing a hotkey or a button in the UI. To create a
task:

- Open the command palette by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.
- Start typing `Tasks: Configure Task`, and select the corresponding option once it comes up.
- Select `Create tasks.json from template`.
- Finally, select `Other`.

This will create a `.vscode` directory in your workspace, and within it, a file named `tasks.json`, which is then opened
in the editor.

::: tip The VS Code command palette

VS Code exposes _all of its functionality_ through the command palette, which can be opened with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>. It's a very useful shortcut to know about, and we'll be using it a bunch
in the next steps.

:::

The `.vscode` directory is where VS Code stores all of its configuration and settings that are specific to the current
workspace. In there, `tasks.json` is a text file which will contain the tasks configured for your workspace. Right now
it should be looking something like this:
![The default tasks.json file in VS Code](/assets/vscode-default-tasks-json.png)

It helps if you're familiar with the JSON format, but it's also fine if you're not. This is how tasks are defined for
your workspace. The field labeled `"tasks"` is a list, which begins with `[` and ends with `]`, and inside this list we
currently have one object, delimited by the pair of curly brackets `{` and `}`, at lines 6 and 10 in the image above.
This object is a task, and its own fields define the properties of the task. Here we can see that it's a shell command
(field `"type"`) labeled "echo" (field `"label"`) and that the command ran by this task is `echo Hello` (field
`"command"`).

You can try to run it right away, by opening the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and
selecting `Tasks: Run task` (start typing and select it when it shows up). Then, choose `echo` in the dropdown. At this
point, you'll be presented with one more dropdown, asking you to
`Select for which kind of errors and warnings to scan the task output`. In the options below, select
`Never scan the task output for this task`. You'll notice that a new field gets added to our task object in the
`tasks.json` file: `"problemMatcher": []`. This field is used to tell VS Code how to parse errors in the output of the
task in order to put red squiggles under the appropriate places in your code. It's a bit of a pain to configure
properly, and we don't need it anyway, since Clangd already handles red squiggles for us. `"problemMatcher": []`
basically corresponds to "no problem matcher", so we're clear on that end. Finally, you should have noticed that `Hello`
was printed in your terminal. This means the task worked! Run it once again, and notice that VS Code no longer pesters
you about scanning the output for problems -- because the task is now configured to do nothing about that.

Printing `Hello` in the terminal seems a bit silly, but we're going to tweak this task so that it compiles our code for
us. No more typing in the terminal! You can go ahead and perform the following replacements in the task object:

- Change `echo Hello` to the compile command you used previously (`clang++ prog.cpp -o my_first_program.exe` or
  similar).
- Change `"label": "echo"` to something more descriptive of our purposes, for example `"label": "Compile"`.

Don't forget to save. You can then run the task like you did before (it will have a different label), and observe it
compile your C++ file for you. Try putting nonsense in your C++ file, don't forget to save, and errors should show up in
the terminal when you run the task. If nothing gets printed, it means the compilation was successful.

Let's add a task which runs the compiled program. In `tasks.json`, duplicate the task object and add a comma between the
two objects. In the second object, change the label to `"Run"`, and the command to `"./my_first_program.exe"`. The
result should look like this:

```json :no-line-numbers
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Compile",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "clang++ prog.cpp -o my_first_program.exe",
      "problemMatcher": []
    },
    {
      "label": "Run",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "./my_first_program.exe",
      "problemMatcher": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Now you can run the `Compile` task, followed by the `Run` task, in order to compile your C++ code and run the generated
executable. But running two tasks in a row isn't very convenient. Luckily, we can automate this too: add a new field
`"dependsOn"` to the `Run` task object (don't forget to separate it from the previous field by a comma), and have its
value match the label of the `Compile` task. Your `Run` task should look like this:

```json :no-line-numbers
{
  "label": "Run",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "./my_first_program.exe",
  "problemMatcher": [],
  "dependsOn": "Compile"
}
```

Now, when you run the `Run` task, the `Compile` task will be ran first, and only then the `Run` task will run.

This is all getting rather convenient and usable, but it can get better. We can define one task to be the default build
task, which gives it a dedicated keyboard shortcut. Open the command palette again, and select
`Tasks: Configure Default Build Task`. In the dropdown, select the `Compile` task. Now, you get to compile your code
with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>. If you take a look at the `tasks.json` file, you'll notice that VS
Code has updated the `Compile` task to reflect that it is now the default build task, by adding a field
`"group": {"kind": "build", "isDefault": true}`.

::: tip What about the `Run` task?

You might be wondering why we didn't bind the `Run` task to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, since it
would run the `Compile` task too. To keep it short, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> is the shortcut
associated with building your code, which is a different thing from running the built executable. Not to worry however,
we're getting a shortcut for running your build right in the next section, with an added bonus.

## Setting up the debugger

The debugger allows you to pause your program _while_ it executes and to inspect its memory while it's paused. When you
write a bug, at some later point you'll notice that your program doesn't do what it's supposed to do. When that's the
case, your first reflex should be to run your program with the debugger. By seeing the code executing step by step on
your screen, inspecting the contents of variables and checking your assumptions as you go, you'll be able to track the
issue directly back to where it originates. The debugger won't fix the issue for you, but it's pretty much the fastest,
tried-and-true way to identify the issue and understand why it happens.

::: warning Do not skip this section!

The debugger is your most invaluable tool right next to the compiler. Without a compiler, you can't turn your code into
an executable. Without a debugger, you're setting up yourself for painfully hard times understanding why your code
behaves wrong -- and it will, eventually. It's not a skill issue, you _will_ write bugs, everyone does. Some bugs are
trivial to find and fix, some others much less so. When you encounter the latter kind, you'll be glad to have a debugger
at your disposal.

We'll be installing LLDB-DAP. Much like Clangd, LLDB-DAP is a program that we have to install _via_ MSYS2, and then we
need to add an extension to VS Code, which will be the middle man between the installed LLDB and VS Code itself.

::: tip

The actual debugger is called LLDB. `DAP` stands for _debug adapter protocol_, kind of a specification which states how
debuggers should "speak" to VS Code. LLDB-DAP simply wraps the plain LLDB executable, but "speaks in DAP" so that VS
Code can understand it.

An extension is still needed on top of all that for proper integration within VS Code's UI.

:::

Open up the MSYS2 CLANG64 terminal again, run the command `pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-lldb` and let it do its
thing. That's it for installing LLDB.

Then, open VS Code's extension marketplace, search for `LLDB DAP`, and install the first result:
![LLDB DAP in the VS Code marketplace](/assets/vscode-lldb-dap.png)

Now we need to tell the extension where to find the LLDB-DAP executable. Click the LLDB DAP entry from the search
results in the extension marketplace pane to open the extension's overview. Near the `Disable` and `Uninstall` buttons,
there should be a small cog on the right. Click it and select `Settings` in the dropdown menu which appears:
![Opening LLDB DAP's settings in VS Code](/assets/vscode-lldb-dap-settings.png)

You'll be taken to the extension settings. In that page, locate the `Lldb-dap: Executable-path` setting (you can use the
search bar at the top), and put `C:/msys64/clang64/bin/lldb-dap.exe` as the value.

::: tip Opening VS Code's settings

You can also open the settings from the top bar, by selecting `File`â†’`Preferences`â†’`Settings`, or from the command
palette, by selecting `Preferences: Open settings (UI)`. Once in there, use the search bar to locate a particular
setting. You'll find both settings for VS Code itself and settings for installed extensions in this page.

:::

We're almost ready to debug our program. There's one more thing we need to change: debugging a program requires that the
executable is built in a way that makes it debug-friendly, and for that we need to provide an additional option to our
Clang compile command. Open your `tasks.json` file (in the `.vscode` folder), and add the `-g` option to the command
line for your `Compile` task. It should now read something like `clang++ prog.cpp -o my_first_program.exe -g`. **Run the
`Compile` task right away.** If you don't, later you'll be attempting to debug an executable which was not built for
debugging purposes, and it's going to be confusing.

And last but not least, we need to tell VS Code how to start our program in a debug session with LLDB DAP. Click on the
`Run and Debug` button in the left sidebar. In the pane that opens, click on `create a launch.json file`, and select the
`LLDB DAP Debugger` option in the dropdown:  
![The Run and Debug button in VS Code](/assets/vscode-run-and-debug.png)

This creates a file named `launch.json` next to the `tasks.json` file in the `.vscode` folder:
![launch.json file in VS Code](/assets/vscode-launch-json.png)

This file is meant to contain all debug configurations for your workspace. Much like `tasks.json`, it mainly consists in
a list of configurations, of which there is currently only one. It's slightly more complex than tasks, but we don't have
to do much to make it work: simply replace `<your program>` by the name of the executable file generated by your compile
command, `my_first_program.exe` if we were to continue the examples from above. `${workspaceRoot}` is a configuration
variable which contains the path to your C++ workspace. Do not touch it, just leave it alone and keep the slash between
it and your program name: `${workspaceRoot}/my_first_program.exe`. **Make sure you save the file after editing it.**

You are now ready to debug! Let's make your program do a couple more interesting things than just printing to the
console. Copy and paste this in your C++ file:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x = 2;
    int y = 3;
    int z = x + y;

    std::cout << "z is " << z;
}
```

In order for these changes to make it to the compiled executable, you can go ahead and run your `Compile` task once
more.

Then, click on line 5, on the left of the line numbers. A red dot should appear:
![A breakpoint in VS Code](/assets/vscode-breakpoint.png)

This is called a _breakpoint_. When your program runs in a debug session, it will be paused when the execution reaches
this line. Actually, let's just try it. Follow these instructions:

- Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start debugging. Pretty much immediately, the line with the breakpoint should become
  highlighted in yellow and a bunch of stuff should have showed up in the `Run and Debug` pane on the left.
  ![Local variables in VS Code during a debug session](/assets/vscode-locals-during-debug.png)

- Press F10 to execute the highlighted line of code. Now line 6 should be highlighted in yellow, and the value of `x` in
  the left pane should have changed to `2`.
- Press F10 one more time to execute line 6, advancing execution by one line again. Line 7 should now be highlighted,
  and `y` in the left pane should have taken `3` as value.
- Press F10 one last time, executing line 7. You should now see that `z` in the left pane has a new value: `5`, which
  turns out to be the result of `x + y` (whose values were 2 and 3 respectively when the addition was carried out).
- Finally, press `F5` to resume execution until the next breakpoint. Since there are no more breakpoints, our program
  just finishes running.

::: tip F5?

While _not_ in a debug session, <kbd>F5</kbd> is the shortcut to run the current debug configuration. You can see the
currently selected debug configuration at the top of the `Run and Debug` pane of VS Code:
![The selected debug configuration VS Code](/assets/vscode-selected-debug-config.png)

_During_ a debug session, <kbd>F5</kbd> is the shortcut to resume execution until the next breakpoint is encountered (at
which point the program pauses again).

:::

What about the last line in the program? Wasn't it supposed to print something? Yes, and it did. However, the output
generated by programs during debug sessions goes to a dedicated tab called the `Debug Console`. It should be visible by
default right next your terminal tab, but if not you can bring it up by selecting `View`â†’`Debug Console` in the top bar.
Open up the debug console, and hopefully this is what you should see:  
![The debug console in VS Code](/assets/vscode-debug-console.png)

The console output is there, and we also get the confirmation that our program exited normally after resuming (this is
what `status = 0`) means.

### Troubleshooting

#### When I press `F5` I get this error window

![A common error when launching debug sessions in VS Code](/assets/vscode-launch-error.png)

You did not edit your `launch.json` file correctly, or you forgot to save it.

#### None of the stuff shown above appears in the `Run and Debug` pane during the debug session

You forgot to recompile your program after adding option `-g` to your compile command. Make sure that `-g` is present in
your compile command (task `Compile`) and that your `tasks.json` file is saved. Run your `Compile` task and try
debugging again.

### Bonus

Every time you want to run or debug your code after having made changes to your source files or to your compile command,
you'll have to rebuild your executable. If you don't, you'll notice confusing inconcistencies and will be left wondering
why they happen. Not noticing that you're debugging or running an outdated build can result in wasted effort. Lots of
it. Fortunately, this is avoidable: leave to someone else the responsibility of remembering to rebuild!

Open your `launch.json` file, and add a new field after the last one: `"preLaunchTask": "Compile"`. Don't forget to
insert a comma between this field and the previous one, and to save the file once you have edited it. As of now, every
time you launch a debug session with this configuration, the `Compile` task will be ran, generating an up-to-date
executable that the debug session will then be started on.
